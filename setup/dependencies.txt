# ProMOC Assembly System Dependencies
# This file lists all Python and system dependencies required for the ProMOC Assembly ROS2 packages

# === SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (install via apt) ===
# For PMCLib (.NET integration):
# Option 1 (preferred): .NET Core/SDK 8.0
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0 aspnetcore-runtime-8.0
#
# Option 2 (fallback): Mono runtime  
# sudo apt-get install -y mono-complete mono-devel
#
# Additional build dependencies:
# sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g
# sudo apt-get install -y clang libglib2.0-dev

# === PYTHON DEPENDENCIES ===

# Core Python dependencies for hardware integration
pythonnet>=3.0.0  # Required for PMCLib integration with .NET libraries (planar_motor_nodes)
pylablib>=1.4.0   # Required for Thorlabs hardware control (linear_axis_nodes)

# Additional dependencies for pylablib
pyserial>=3.4      # Serial communication for Thorlabs devices
pyusb>=1.0.0       # USB communication support
numpy>=1.20.0      # Required by pylablib

# ROS2 Python dependencies (typically installed with ROS2)
rclpy  # ROS2 Python client library
std_msgs  # Standard ROS2 message types
geometry_msgs  # Geometry-related message types
sensor_msgs  # Sensor-related message types

# Build tools for pythonnet (if build from source is needed)
wheel>=0.36.0      # Required for building pythonnet

# Development and testing dependencies
pytest>=6.0.0     # Testing framework
flake8>=3.8.0     # Code linting
pep257>=0.7.0     # Docstring style checker

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
scipy>=1.7.0      # Scientific computing (if needed for advanced motion planning)

# Note: ROS2 dependencies are typically managed through rosdep and package.xml files
# This file is primarily for Python-specific dependencies not covered by ROS2 package management
